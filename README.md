I have done some basic image processing using skimage.
Converting Image to Binary: This process involves converting a color or grayscale image into a binary image, i.e., an image that has only two colors, black and white. This is often done by selecting a threshold value, and then setting all pixel values less than the threshold to black, and all pixel values greater than or equal to the threshold to white. This can be useful for tasks like object detection and recognition.
Enhancing Image Details: Enhancing image details can involve a variety of techniques, such as sharpening, contrast adjustment, and histogram equalization. These techniques can make subtle details in the image more visible and can be particularly useful for tasks like feature extraction.
